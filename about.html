    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Darisee Peebles and this is my first attempt at a blog page. This is a personalized assignment for my INLS 161 class for us to express 
      through a personal webpage, while also learning about the tools we have at disposal for creating web content. So to start off here's a little background/fun information on me:
  </p>
  <li>I was born in Ahoskie, NC, which is located in northeastern North Carolina. My family moved to Greensboro, NC when I was 3. </li>
  <li> I am a musician. My  primary instrument is trumpet, but I also own a bass guitar (but I've yet to learn it). </li>
  <li>My dad works for Hewlett-Packard under a contract for Bank of America. My mom works temporarily for a packaging company but just graduated with an Associate's in Business Adminsistration.</li>
  
  <p>
    I consider myself very nerdy and is interested in things considered as such. I am also very much interested in Japanese culture - so much,
    I decided to minor in the study of the language. I am also a Google and Android enthusiat, so you may see some tech posts here from time to time.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I hope to use this experience to create this into something of its own and have an active presence on the web, while also learning more about the tools at my disposal. 
    So please, have a look around and stay tuned for more!
  </p>
