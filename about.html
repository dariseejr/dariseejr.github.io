    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>My name is Darisee Peebles and I am currently a junior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Go Heels! This is my first attempt at creating 
  a blog page and I want this to be a space where I can freely express myself and do what I want. Some background information on me:</p>
  <li>I was born in Ahoskie, NC which is located in northeastern North Carolina, but moved to Greensboro when I was 3.</li>
  <li>I am a musician. My primary instrument is trumpet, but I own a bass guitar as well (even though I dislike everything bass clef).</li>
  <li>My father works as a computer technician for Hewlett-Packard under a contract for Bank of America. My mother works as a temporarily under a packaging company, but she just graduated with an Associate's in Business Administration.</li>
  <br><p>
   I am a nerd at heart and love everything that is considered as such. I am also into Japanese culture - so much I even decideed to minor in the study of the language.
   I'm also a avid user of Android devices and love the OS and Google's products. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I am an overall loveable guy with a knack for sarcasm, so take a look around and see what I'm up to!
