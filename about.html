    <h1>About me</h1>
 <p>
  My name is Darisee Peebles and I am currently a junior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Go Heels! This is my first attempt at creating 
  a blog page and I want this to be a space where I can freely express myself and do what I want. Some background information on me:</p>
  <li>I was born in Ahoskie, NC which is located in northeastern North Carolina, but moved to Greensboro when I was 3.</li>
  <li>I am a musician. My primary instrument is trumpet, but I own a bass guitar as well (even though I dislike everything bass clef).</li>
  <li>My father works as a computer technician for Hewlett-Packard under a contract for Bank of America. My mother works as a temporarily under a packaging company, but she just graduated with an Associate's in Business Administration.</li>
  <br><p>
   I am a nerd at heart and love everything that is considered as such. I am also into Japanese culture - so much I even decideed to minor in the study of the language.
   I'm also a avid user of Android devices and love the OS and Google's products. 
  </p>

    I am an overall loveable guy with a knack for sarcasm, so take a look around and see what I'm up to!

    <p>Hello, my name is Darisee Peebles and this is my first attempt at a blog page. This is a personalized assignment for my INLS 161 class for us to express 
      through a personal webpage, while also learning about the tools we have at disposal for creating web content. So to start off here's a little background/fun information on me:
  </p>
  <li>I was born in Ahoskie, NC, which is located in northeastern North Carolina. My family moved to Greensboro, NC when I was 3. </li>
  <li> I am a musician. My  primary instrument is trumpet, but I also own a bass guitar (but I've yet to learn it). </li>
  <li>My dad works for Hewlett-Packard under a contract for Bank of America. My mom works temporarily for a packaging company but just graduated with an Associate's in Business Adminsistration.</li>
  
  <p>
    I consider myself very nerdy and is interested in things considered as such. I am also very much interested in Japanese culture - so much,
    I decided to minor in the study of the language. I am also a Google and Android enthusiat, so you may see some tech posts here from time to time.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I hope to use this experience to create this into something of its own and have an active presence on the web, while also learning more about the tools at my disposal. 
    So please, have a look around and stay tuned for more!
