Here it is. This will be the last post for the purposes of the class. This time, we were tasked with creating
a presentation entirely online. For the purposes of this, we used Reveal.js, which is a cool mix of HTML, JavaScript,
and CSS, that creates slides that are viewable on any web browser. 

We chose groups for this project and I got to work with two amazing people with great personailities. Reflecting our
goofy personailities, is our actual presentation topic: the beef between Taylor Swift and Kanye West. In it we talk about 
the conflict between Taylor Swift and Kanye West, starting from his interruptive behavior in the 2009 VMAs to the recent
fiasco over Kanye's controversial song "Famous". We had a good time working on the topic, and as light-hearted as it was,
I'm really proud of the work we have done.

You can look at the presentation [here](https://dariseejr.github.io/task-6-be-presentable/). 

Also I want to take the time to reflect a little bit on this class. First off, I want to say that this was a truely valuable class to me
because I learned so much from it in such a short time. And the material was things I was interested in as well. I get so excited when I
think about all the different ways I could utilize the tools we used in class. Also, I believe that this class has solidified my decision 
in wanting to continue with the SILS degree program. The content is intruiging and the instructors and professors seem wonderful (so far, haha).
So, in conclusion, I'm really glad I took this class. 

Here's to hopes on a good grade and a wonderful experience afterwards. 

'Till next time,
