First of all, **-lets out huge sigh-**

I just finished working on an assignment that required us to use PanDoc to write a script
that automstically converts a Markdown file into other document files. Let me say that getting
PanDoc to work on the small containers in CodeAnywhere is **very** frustrating! The packages
for LaTeX are too big to install on the containers, but I finally got the command to execute.

Well, here are the fruits of my labor; bringing it back old-school with my Carolina admissions essay:

* [Markdown](https://github.com/dariseejr/task-3-convert-documents/raw/master/task-3.md)
* [PDF](https://github.com/dariseejr/task-3-convert-documents/raw/master/task-3.pdf)
* [DOCX](https://github.com/dariseejr/task-3-convert-documents/raw/master/task-3.docx)
* [HTML](https://github.com/dariseejr/task-3-convert-documents/raw/master/task-3.html)
* [ODT](https://github.com/dariseejr/task-3-convert-documents/raw/master/task-3.odt)

Well, regardless of how frustating it turned out to be, it's done. I'm pretty proud of myself.
