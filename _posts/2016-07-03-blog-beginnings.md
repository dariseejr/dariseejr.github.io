Welcome to my first blog ever for INLS 161! I think that this is a really cool class 
to begin with and I'm really interested to see what we will be able to achieve
towards the end of the class.

We were tasked with the assignment of purposing our webpage to serve a personal
interest - but, I still don't know what I want to do with it currently.
I'll probably end up making about two or so posts a week, chronicling my expeiences
in class and while I'm here in Chapel Hill for the rest of the summer. Either
way, I hope for some really cool experience with this as I add more to this
little webpage.

See you on the flipside,
