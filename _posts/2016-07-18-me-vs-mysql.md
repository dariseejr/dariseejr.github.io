**OKAY!**

So we recently just went over database software and handling data using the features
of these systems. For our lesson, we used a database software called MySQL. It is a database 
software that can organize Comma-Seperated Values (.CSV) or Tab-Seperated Values (.TSV)
files into tables with colums and the ability to initialize the columns with different
value types (such as integer or characters). In all sense of it, standard database software.

In this recent assignemt, we had to mix the *worse* of both worlds: scripting and databasing.
My group created a questionnaire that recorded the answers into a csv file.
In addition to that, we were also tasked with creating a script that recorded the answers
into a table. The hard part of the assignment was the requirement of mixing scripted actions
to follow a logical progression of creating and inserting of the data from the csv file to a table - 
including the addition of new information! At first we didn't understand that was neccessary,
but then we learned with a huge amount of trial-and-error. But after a lot of tries,
a few Google searches, and a sprinkle of fairy dust, my group finally created the script!
Here's a link to the git respository where it's stored:

Overall, a difficult, but awarding assignment!

'Till next time,
